abstract = {The number of orbits of a permutation group was determined in a fundamental result of Burnside. This was extended in a classical paper by Pólya to a solution of the problem of enumerating the equivalence classes of functions with a given weight from a set X into a set Y, subject to the action of the permutation group A acting on X. A generalization by de Bruijn solved the counting problem when two permutation groups are involved, A acting on X and B on Y. Thus the Pólya formula is the special case of the de Bruijn result in which B is the identity group. The Power Group Enumeration Theorem achieves the same result using only one permutation group: the power group, BA, acting on the set YX of functions. de Bruijn's method was used to count self-complementary graphs by R. C. Read and finite automata by M. Harrison. These results as well as the number of self-converse directed graphs and others are easily obtained by the proper use of the Power Group Enumeration Theorem.}

  abstract = {This second volume of a two-volume basic introduction to enumerative combinatorics covers the composition of generating functions, trees, algebraic generating functions, D-finite generating functions, noncommutative generating functions, and symmetric functions. The chapter on symmetric functions provides the only available treatment of this subject suitable for an introductory graduate course on combinatorics, and includes the important Robinson-Schensted-Knuth algorithm. Also covered are connections between symmetric functions and representation theory. An appendix by Sergey Fomin covers some deeper aspects of symmetric function theory, including jeu de taquin and the Littlewood-Richardson rule. As in Volume 1, the exercises play a vital role in developing the material. There are over 250 exercises, all with solutions or references to solutions, many of which concern previously unpublished results. Graduate students and research mathematicians who wish to apply combinatorics to their work will find this an authoritative reference},
